# White Sox Play Data Simulation

This demo written by me, [Curt Grimes](https://curtgrimes.com), takes [play data](./src/data.json) from the White Sox v. Tigers game on Saturday, June 12, 2021 and presents it alongside a synchronized video of the play. The user can hover over player jersey numbers on the map to see who they are.
